# Offline Signature Verification-Artificial-Neural-Network (MS Course Project)

A tool using MATLAB that verifies whether a signature is true or forged by training Artificial Neural Networks with over 200 signature samples from 10 different persons.
This involved image acquisition, image pre-processing, feature extraction, creation of feature vector and training the neural network.
Tested the tool with both correct and incorrect signatures of the same individuals.
